[Voice Talking:] But anyway I... I... I like to value my
Relationship with women. You know sometimes I get so
Deeply involved I just, I just have to feel like
Oral sex would complete our relationship

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin In The Valley
A delicious break from Potatoes
Yo Da Laheeeeoooooooo
Here we go
Yo, Yo, Yo Da Laheeeooooo
Let 'em know how I'm layin
Unusual kinda casual yes with me girls are obsessed
To get undressed
Get fresh and have me
Yodle In The Valley
And I'd do it at the drop of a dime (dime)
Sometimes goin' from behind (from behind)
Slowly strokin, no jokin
My tongue just keeps on pokin
And the best type of oochie coochie
Is the type that tastes like sushi
Eat it
Watch a girl get frisky
And then wash it down with a shot of whiskey

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin In The Valley
Yeah Kid Rock Kid Rock
Yo Da Laheoooo

Yo here's a story
(Check it out)
I remember when I spent the night at Sally's house
Woke up with Cotton Mouth
Couldn't speak
My tongue was weak
From Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Oh I love them mountain thighs
And a pizza pie before my eyes
But before I taste them juices
I make sure this Sally douches
But she's not the only one
I like to Yodle On
It sounds wicky wacky ticky tacky
But yo you know that I'm most happy

Yo-Da-Lin In The Valley
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo Da Lin The Valley
A delicious break from potatoes

Yo Da Laheoooooo
Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yo, Yodalin in the valley

Girls think I'm a freak 'cause I don't speak
Whisper In their ear and make it clear

Sorry dear don't hate
'Cause I'm not gonna say I love you when your sitting upon my face
Oh yes It's warm and wet
In the valley you bet (bet)
And get this, one girl I yodled on
Had a bush thicker than the amazon
Forest
I felt like a tourist
A backpacker
Oh shit where's my weedwacker
Came out with hair on my toungue
But still I got the job done

Do what you have to
I do what I had to
To break through a pick a style that sticks like glue
And as I rank I wanna thank no one
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
You helped me around
My parents put me down
I never skipped town
I stood my ground
We kept showin up
Drinkin' and throwin' up
Rap was my life
As I was growin' up
Actin' a fool in school no one topped us
Smart ass in class at times abnoxious
Drivin' a bronco
Runnin' my own show
And pullin the look a like Marilyn Monroe hoes
And me and Bo got together
Made sense
Spent many nights in Mt. Clemens basements
I scratched records and performed a few tricks
KDC mix let the Black man talk shit
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
Who holds it down like Bad Leroy Brown
Now I won't stop cause yo I'm Kid Rock
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done

F-F-Fames a costin the price ain't nice
It's like the roll of the dice
For a whole new life
But don't get my song wrong
I enjoy it alot
Walkin' around like a big shot
'Cause I'm Kid Rock
Smooth as an ice cube
Cool as an igloo
And more complex, than a rubix cube
A healthy wealthy young one with a quick tongue
Smart from the start and from the heart my rhymes run
And as I incline through time to get mine
I try not to slide, but walk a straight line
Though it's hard when the climb gets steep
The one who finds is the one who seeks
So I sought and fought
And alot I got taught
And although I left those who stole got caught
Many shows I rocked
Many suckers I laughed at
And those who snapped back usually got slapped
The cat if I was strap
'Cause I was a sun of a gun
Livin' life on the run
Now I pleaded 18 and outdone by none
Bold, Young, Handsome, Bad like Bronson
Pumpin the new sounds town to town
And when in motown I cool out in Greektown
On the upside with nothin' too high
The Genuine Article

They don't want me
'Cause I worked like a bitch to get the job done
Chuck nice break that beat down
Uh huh... Uh huh... Uh huh
KDC... huh

Six Generations of rap and I'm first
Ready to burst, the style is rehearsed
I worked and worked and worked and I worked
When many thought I was just gettin' jerked
Used, abused, but I paid my dues
And now no one out there could fill my shoes
And my pants and do this dance
This shit didn't happen by chance
It went slow not quick, but now I'm your pick
Ain't that a trip when I started from zip
And now up and up and up I won't stop
The flop just pop the flat top the Kid Rock
Yes me the low key MC
With the ability to rock a party
Anywhere and make people stare
I'm lookin' while I'm cookin with no care
Pumpin the new sound town to town
Who holds it down like bad Leroy Brown
And still I won't stop growin' this flat top

They don't want me
